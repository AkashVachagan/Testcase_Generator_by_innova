As a software tester, I want to be able to easily create and execute test cases, so that I can identify and report any issues or bugs.  Acceptance criteria:  Test case creation should be straightforward and easy to use. The testing process should be well-documented and communicated to all team members. Issues or bugs should be reported through a standardized process, such as a bug tracking system.
